# TODO: Fix Register/Login Issues

- [x] Add console logs to server/src/controllers/authController.js in register and login functions for debugging req.body, validation, and errors.
- [x] User: Restart server (`cd server && npm run dev`) if not running.
- [ ] User: Test register with new valid data (e.g., username: "testuser", email: "test@example.com", password: "password123").
- [ ] User: Test login with same credentials.
- [ ] User: Share server console output and any new errors.
- [ ] Analyze logs to identify root cause (e.g., body parsing, DB, validation).
- [ ] Fix identified issues (e.g., adjust validation, fix proxy if needed).
- [ ] Verify full auth flow works.
